<p align="center">
  The simplest option for recording and replaying user journeys üéØ
</p>

If you have a live website, users will be interacting with it. But recording these sessions for further analysis can be challenging.
**Jornada** makes this easy, enabling both session record and replay, allowing teams to have insights from user interactions. Some use cases:

- Debug reported issues
- User behaviour and experience analysis

> ‚ò¢Ô∏è WARNING: although this version is better than the [original prototype hack code][1], this project is still not recommended for developers 
> with accute hacky code alergy. It might still contain some hacky solutions, and some choices might make people scream (SQLite). ‚ò¢Ô∏è

## Installation

### MacOS

Use `brew` to install it

```
brew install brunoluiz/tap/mermaid-server
```

### Linux and Windows

## Usage in your frontend application

To use this, add the following snippet to your app (at the end of `<body>`) and then head to http://localhost:3000 to see recorded sessions

```js
<script type="application/javascript" src="http://localhost:3000/record.js" ></script>
<script type="application/javascript">
  // Once record.js is imported, the setter functions can be called at any point in your application
  window.recorder
    .setUser({
      id: 'USER_ID',
      email: 'test@test.com',
      name: 'Bruno Luiz Silva'
    })
    .setMeta({ foo: 'bar' })
    .setClientId('client-id')
</script>
```

## Development

### Running locally

- Install `go` and `gcc` tooling
- Get SQLite `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`
- `go run ./cmd/jornada`
- By default, it will be served on `http://localhost:3000`

### Architecture

Refer to [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for more informations about the service implementation.
